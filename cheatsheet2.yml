# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world! Im deploying my resources from Github Actions

      # Hej, kig her! Vi skal have kørt nogle az cli scripts. Det gør vi her. Tjek evt linie 36
            # Husk, vi skal logge ind først - mon der findes en action for det? Spørg Google :) 

      
      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a MULTI-line script
        run: |
          echo This is my first line
          echo This is my second line
          echo "So the | symbol allows me to run multiple lines?"          
          echo Can I somehow use this to deploy my resources?
